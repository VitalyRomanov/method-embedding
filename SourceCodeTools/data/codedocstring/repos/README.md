Download list of repositories as zip files. 

`git2zip.py` creates an `sh` script that downloads zip files and stores them into the current folder.

`git2zip.py` reads the list of repositories from stdin in the format `https://github.com/gousiosg/java-callgraph`.

Use `explore-codesearcnet.ipynb` to extract github repositories from codesearchnet data.  Can use them to index with own tools.
